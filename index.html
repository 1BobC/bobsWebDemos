<h1>Briefly going back to first attempt with PHP:</h1>
<!-- <p><?php
            echo 
            "Hello to you!\n";
?>      
<?php
            $data = array("a", "b", "c");
            echo 
            $data[0];
            echo 
            "Thank you TWD";
?></p> -->
<h1>PHP Syntax Example</h1>
<!-- <?php
echo "PHP Powers almost 80% of the Modern Web.";
?> -->
<p>None of the above runs in html datei, weil das ist nicht ein php Datei, So placed in first express file</p>

    <p>Part one will completely process incoming data but produce no output.
    Part two will produce page output</p>
    <h3>The MVC loops continuously... User -> Controller -> Model -> View -> and back to User</h3>
    <p>Controller orchestrates and routes and passes Context to the View. Upper Controller contains 
        no html and lower Controller contains no d/base</p>
    <h3>Summary Forms $_GET & $_POST, Sanitising html, Data validation, Form fields, New form fields in html, MVC</h3>
