<h2><strong>For all work prior to MVC on Dr Chuck's video see index file in chucksWebDemos
and from MVC forward in this file</strong></h2>
<h1>Briefly going back to first attempt with PHP:</h1>
<!-- <p><?php
            echo 
            "Hello to you!\n";
?>      
<?php
            $data = array("a", "b", "c");
            echo 
            $data[0];
            echo 
            "Thank you TWD";
?></p> -->
<h1>PHP Syntax Example</h1>
<!-- <?php
echo "PHP Powers almost 80% of the Modern Web.";
?> -->
<p>None of the above runs in html datei, weil das ist nicht ein php Datei, So placed in first express file</p> 

<h4>from 05:00:43 This simple MVC provides a pattern to process POST data</h4>
    <p>Part one will completely process incoming data but produce no output.
    Part two will produce page output</p>
    <h3>The MVC loops continuously... User -> Controller -> Model -> View -> and back to User</h3>
    <p>Controller orchestrates and routes and passes Context to the View. Upper Controller contains 
        no html and lower Controller contains no d/base</p>
    <h3>Summary Forms $_GET & $_POST, Sanitising html, Data validation, Form fields, New form fields in html, MVC</h3>
    <h3>Continue with 05:11:50 Coding of forms</h3>
    <p>Access https://www.wa4e.com/code/forms/ done</p>
    <p>At 05:19:00 ish, oldguess and form input vulnerability - Cross site scripting - THIS IS BAD HACKING! GET TO KNOW THIS! </p>
    <p>Guessing game walk through done to 05:39:15</p>

<h2>New Subject - From 05:39:15 Rel D/bases and SQL</h2>
<p>Terminology - Database, containing many tables. Relation (or table) contains tuples and attributes. Tuple (or row) is a set of fields representing an object. Attribute (also column or field) is one of the elements of the object.</p>
<p>The following exercises are based on us being the DB Administrator with DBs and SQL</p>
<p>With SQL we will create a table, retrieve, insert and delete data.</p>
<p>Three major systems - Oracle, MySQL (open source), Sql Server plus many smaller eg. HSQL, SQLite, Postgress...</p>
<h4>SQL installed and tested in vs code Start 05:39:24 Rel DB and my sql</h4>
