<h2><strong>For all work prior to MVC on Dr Chuck's video see index file in chucksWebDemos
and from MVC forward in this file</strong></h2>
<h1>Briefly going back to first attempt with PHP:</h1>
<!-- <p><?php
            echo 
            "Hello to you!\n";
?>      
<?php
            $data = array("a", "b", "c");
            echo 
            $data[0];
            echo 
            "Thank you TWD";
?></p> -->
<h1>PHP Syntax Example</h1>
<!-- <?php
echo "PHP Powers almost 80% of the Modern Web.";
?> -->
<p>None of the above runs in html datei, weil das ist nicht ein php Datei, So placed in first express file</p> 

<h4>from 05:00:43 This simple MVC provides a pattern to process POST data</h4>
    <p>Part one will completely process incoming data but produce no output.
    Part two will produce page output</p>
    <h3>The MVC loops continuously... User -> Controller -> Model -> View -> and back to User</h3>
    <p>Controller orchestrates and routes and passes Context to the View. Upper Controller contains 
        no html and lower Controller contains no d/base</p>
    <h3>Summary Forms $_GET & $_POST, Sanitising html, Data validation, Form fields, New form fields in html, MVC</h3>
    <h3>Continue with 05:11:50 Coding of forms</h3>
    <p>Access https://www.wa4e.com/code/forms/ done</p>
    <p>At 05:19:00 ish, oldguess and form input vulnerability - Cross site scripting - THIS IS BAD HACKING! GET TO KNOW THIS! </p>
    <p>Guessing game walk through done to 05:39:15</p>

<h2>New Subject - From 05:39:15 Rel D/bases and SQL</h2>
<p>Terminology - Database, containing many tables. Relation (or table) contains tuples and attributes. Tuple (or row) is a set of fields representing an object. Attribute (also column or field) is one of the elements of the object.</p>
<p>The following exercises are based on us being the DB Administrator with DBs and SQL</p>
<p>With SQL we will create a table, retrieve, insert and delete data.</p>
<p>Three major systems - Oracle, MySQL (open source), Sql Server plus many smaller eg. HSQL, SQLite, Postgress...</p>
<h4>SQL installed and tested in vs code Start 05:39:24 Rel DB and my sql</h4>
<p>Commands can be entered in a variety of interfaces - in my case via VScode or Terminal command line</p>
<p>Yes - 05:54:02 created Leute1 then table benutzer then populated, using vscode and comnd line Next remove unwanted line from table</p>
<p>Yes removed items from db inserted items into db and displayed db phew!</p>
<h4>06:02:04 covered basics now for multiple tables - exciting stuff!</h4>
<h4>Reached 06:23:20, restart from here after repeating from 06:02:00 and doing own exercises</h4>
<p>Ok, ready to move on!</p>
<p>Watch to 06:32:12 Data Modeling - Representing Relationships Part 2</p>
<p>Watch to (06:42:52) Data Modeling - Relationships in SQL (Part 3)</p>
<p>Watch to  (06:57:09) Data Modeling - Using Join (Part 4)</p>
<p>Great, now watch it again!!</p>
<h4>main point - Table has primary key, logical key, foreign key... Remember this !!! </h4>
<p>Ok my table will have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>user_id</li>
    <li>first_name</li>
    <li>second_name</li>
    <li>email</li>
    <li>gender</li>
    <li>adult_child</li>
    <li>town</li>
    <li>occupation</li>
    <li>hobby1</li>
    <li>hobby2</li>
    <li>hobby3</li>
</ul>
Actually, NO. I'll be using this for my first RDbase: 
Eca Dbase content
track, eca year, title, artist, len, genre,  artistâ€™s album, group
see Libre office file Eca Dbase content.
Am naming this db EJComp - Estonian Jazz Compilation.
Am coding tables initially on libre file eca dbase content.

At 06:50:46 Adding values to tables (Hold it, I've forgotten the length table!)
